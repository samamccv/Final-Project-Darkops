## App Bar Structure

```dart
Row(

  children: [
    SizedBox(width: 48), // Left spacing for balance
    Expanded(
      child: Center(
        child: Image.asset('images/darkopslogo.png', height: 32),
      ),
    ),
    PopupMenuButton(...), // Profile menu on the right
  ],
)
```

## Dashboard Content Structure (After Changes)

```dart
Column(
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
  children: [
    // Security Scan Statistics Section
    Text('Security Scan Statistics').animate().fadeIn().slideX(),
    _buildTotalScansCard(), // Modern total scans card
    _buildScanTypeCards(), // Individual scan type cards (no trends)

    // Recent Scans Section
    Text('Recent Scans').animate().fadeIn().slideX(),
    _buildRecentScansSection(), // Enhanced recent scans list
  ],
)
```
