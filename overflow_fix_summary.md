# DarkOps Flutter Mobile App - Overflow Fix & Layout Update

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: "BOTTOM OVERFLOWED BY 20 PIXELS" error on all scan cards in the dashboard grid layout.

**Root Cause**: The GridView with `childAspectRatio: 1.4` was creating cards that were too tall for their allocated space, causing content to overflow beyond the card boundaries.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Replaced GridView with Custom Row Layout**
- **Before**: Used `GridView.builder` with automatic sizing
- **After**: Implemented custom `Column` with `Row` widgets for precise control
- **Benefit**: Eliminates automatic sizing conflicts and overflow issues

### 2. **Fixed Height Cards**
- **Implementation**: Set fixed `height: 120` for all cards
- **Consistency**: All scan cards and threat score card now have identical dimensions
- **Result**: No more overflow errors, perfect alignment

### 3. **Threat Score Card Placement**
- **New Position**: Placed beside APK Scans card in the third row
- **Layout**: 2x2 grid for first 4 scan types, then APK + Threat Score in bottom row
- **Design**: Maintains visual balance and logical grouping

### 4. **Optimized Padding and Spacing**
- **Card Padding**: Reduced from 20px to 16px to fit content better
- **Icon Padding**: Reduced from 12px to 10px for compact design
- **Icon Size**: Reduced from 24px to 20px for better proportions
- **Font Size**: Adjusted from 28px to 24px for main numbers

## Layout Structure

```
Dashboard Layout:
├── Enhanced Total Scans Card
├── Scan Cards Grid:
│   ├── Row 1: [SMS Scans] [Email Scans]
│   ├── Row 2: [URL Scans] [QR Scans]
│   └── Row 3: [APK Scans] [Threat Score]
└── Recent Activity Section
```

## Technical Changes

### New Methods Created:
1. `_buildScanCardsWithThreatScore()` - Custom layout manager
2. `_buildCompactScanCard()` - Fixed-height scan cards
3. `_buildCompactThreatScoreCard()` - Fixed-height threat score card

### Removed Methods:
1. `_buildModernScanTypeGrid()` - Old GridView implementation
2. `_buildMaterialDesign3ScanCard()` - Old variable-height cards
3. `_buildThreatScoreCard()` - Old full-width threat score card

### Key Specifications:
```dart
// Fixed dimensions for all cards
height: 120,
padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),

// Compact icon containers
iconPadding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
iconSize: 20,

// Optimized typography
titleFontSize: 12,
numberFontSize: 24,
```

## Visual Improvements

### 1. **Consistent Card Heights**
- All cards now have uniform 120px height
- Perfect alignment across rows
- No more overflow issues

### 2. **Balanced Layout**
